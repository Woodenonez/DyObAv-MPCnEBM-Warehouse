# Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance: One-shot Prediction (EBM) and Control (MPC)
To explore safer interactions between mobile robots and dynamic obstacles, this work presents a comprehensive approach to collision-free navigation in indoor environments. The proposed approach is an integration of multimodal motion predictions of dynamic obstacles and predictive control for obstacle avoidance. Motion prediction is achieved by an *energy-based* deep learning method that predicts plausible future positions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) solvers later generate collision-free trajectories for mobile robots.

## Quick Start

### OpEn
The NMPC formulation is solved using open source implementation of PANOC, namely [OpEn](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/). Follow the [installation instructions](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/docs/installation) before proceeding. 

### Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate MPC solver
Go to "build_solver.py", use the proper configuration name **cfg_fname** and run
```
python solver_build.py
```
After this, a new directory *mpc_solver* will appear and contain the solver. Then, you are good to go :)

## Use Case
Run *main_base.py* for the warehouse simulation (different scenarios and methods) in Python. The evaluation is activated by setting the *evaluation* variable to **True**.
